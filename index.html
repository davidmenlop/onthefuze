            the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered
            simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to
            propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in
            first, and so he got her.

          <p>
            All children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will
            grow up, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two
            years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another
            flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked
            rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and
            cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all
            that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew
            that she must grow up.

        For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be
        able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was
        frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable.

              Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark
              my words,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting
              into their heads.

              “It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said,
              sighing. She was a tidy child. She explained in quite a
              matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes.
